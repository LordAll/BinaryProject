# BinaryProject

This is not a big project !

---

This project is just a kind of game for me. I want develop and I want make math so, I've created a binary encoder and decoder.

### Function :

* `encodeToBinary()` : Use to encode a decimal number to binary. The value of binary textarea is set with the result
* `decodeToDecimal()` : Use to decode binary to a decimal number, and set value of decimal textarea with the result.
* `binaryToText()` : Convert your binary into decimal and convert your decimal in text.
* `textToBinary()` : Convert your letter and space into ascii code ans convert the decimal into binary (add 0 to have 8bit).
